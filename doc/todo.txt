This file lists tasks, changes, and features that are *planned* for
implementation in Torsion. This listing is meant for tasks that are ready to be
written immediately, or are waiting only on prerequisite tasks.

This is not a comprehensive wishlist. Ideas and plans may be found in other
documents. This is also not a comprehensive listing of known bugs, or of bugs
for which fixes are intended.

Critical priority:
    * Improve the Tor system, particularly in regards to error handling
        - Bundled Tor should detect and report any issues in great detail
        - Watch tor events and info to gather, use, and report information
          on if it is successfully connected and working properly. Requires
          control event handling.
    * Allow cookie authentication in manual Tor config 
    * Optionally remove configuration (including identities) during uninstall
        - Windows installer
        - Debian package
    * Improve alerts for new messages or other events (esp. contact req)
        - Better visibility, possibly including animation, in the contacts list
    * Review OutgoingContactRequest; it may be a memory leak
High priority:
    * System tray support, including notifications
        - Requires an icon of some kind
        - Provide options to control notification behavior; note that some
          users may wish for the application to keep a very low profile, and
          not show names or text on screen without their explicit action
    * Allow adding oneself as a contact for testing purposes
        - Treat this normally (i.e. accepting the request), but disable message
          reordering, as it would have broken behavior in this situation
        - Suggested by gmaxwell
    * Context menu for identities
    * Improve communication of self-test/connectivity status for identities
        - ideas/identity-connectivity.txt
    * Mac OS X support
    * Update the contact info page when status changes, particularly requests
    * Use GETCONF to avoid overwriting existing hidden services in Tor
    * Detect config reload on Tor and replace any settings we have
        - Research is needed into how we can detect this situation
    * Options dialog
    * Improve UX of the add contact dialog
        - Consider the situation regarding the nickname & message
        - Don't disable the button
    * Implement the Socialist Millionaires' Protocol as a solution to relay
      attacks from enticing the user to send a request to the wrong contact ID.
      See security/long-term-relay.txt
Normal priority:
    * Allow multi-line chat messages
        - Increase the maximum length for a message/input accordingly
        - Allow shift+enter to create a new line in the input
        - Expand the text input to show the entire message
    * URL handling in chat
        - Allow the user to choose from various options, including clipboard.
        - Allow this to be made a permanent preference; dialog otherwise.
        - Provide tor:// URLs as an option, for torbutton >=1.3.0 users
    * Explicitly handle the time when an identity is being created
        - Display a message on the info page
        - Prevent adding contacts, or prevent the requests from starting
    * Implement redelivery and, possibly, expiration for contact requests
    * Improve error handling around identities, including creation
Low priority:
    * Show the number of outstanding offline messages in the contact list
    * Allow removing offline messages that haven't been sent
    * Drag-and-drop of text into the chat area / input
