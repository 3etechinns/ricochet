In software designed for security and anonymity, public review and
participation is critical to build trust from users and the community. Torsion
cannot succeed without openly discussing design and problems, or without the
participation and research of everyone willing to offer it.

For this reason, it's an explicit goal of this project to be transparent.

This means:

    - Design and technical documentation; open discussion of threats and
      potential solutions.
    - Incorporating external ideas and concepts
    - Encouraging others to become involved in development and design
    - Visible and archived forums for discussion

Of course, not all ideas are usable ideas. Many issues arise with tradeoffs
between goals of the project. Compromises must be found between security and
usability; the user experience can't be harmed to protect against a theoretical
and perhaps impossible attack, but the user's anonymity can't be sacrificed for
their simple convenience. The community and all participants must be equally
open-minded in incorporating other ideas and priorities into their work.

Feedback on ideas for encouraging openness and community participation are
welcomed; for now, you can contact the author (special@dereferenced.net) in
this regard.
