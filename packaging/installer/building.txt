Building the installer requires Inno Setup; see http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

Place the statically linked executable (Torsion.exe) in the installer directory.

You must also place the 'LICENSE' and 'tor.exe' files from the official Tor installer
into the installer\Tor directory, along with a file called 'README' that includes
license and version information.
