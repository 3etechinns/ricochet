Building the installer requires Inno Setup; see http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

Place tor.exe and Torsion.exe in this directory. You will also need the CRT
DLLs from the version of MSVC used, e.g. msvcp110.dll and msvcr110.dll.

In console:

PATH=%PATH%;C:\Path\To\Qt\bin
prepare.bat

Then build from installer.iss to create the installer package.
